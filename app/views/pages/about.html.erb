              Welcome to my website!
            </p>

            <p>
              I am Randy Truong and I am currently looking for an internship or job. I attend University of California Riverside as a Computer Science major. I started programming when I was in Gabrielino High School of my Junior year. I was fortunate enough to attend a high school which provided courses in programming such as Java, C++, etc. I had no idea what programming was, yet was intrigued by how technology influenced the world. Curiosity forced me to enroll. Turns out, this was a decision I would not regret. I am always updating my website so please come by every so often! Have a look around!
